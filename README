TODO:
- Mount volume to host's project directory
- Mount volume to this repo's directory for self modification
- Execute any command in host's shell
  - See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32163955/how-to-run-shell-script-on-host-from-docker-container
  - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/369459/read-named-pipe-once-every-time-input-is-written/369465#369465
  - Run host's process (i.e., NodeJS for specific folder)
  - Run docker/docker compose at host
    - This might be better, to install docker and configure docker and docker-compose to connect to host daemon
- Configure TypeScript autocompletion
  - Latest attempt was unsuccessful and buggy
- Reduce image using multistage build 
- Copy/yank from Neovim does not send to clipboard due to the nature of containers 
  - Workarounds: 
    - use Tmux and just yank from there. How does this work? Isn't Tmux also contained by Docker?
    - Write a file and just open it with vim outside of Docker
- Installing Rust from rustup still failing
- Installing bat to replace cat still failing
- Installing either n or nvm as Node version manager still fail
